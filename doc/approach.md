# Approach

## Report

Create a section called *Approach* and write the followings (preferably in order):

* This section must clearly describe your methodology.
* Do not make the description any data or language specific. Even if you end up experimenting on only one dataset, the methodology explained in this section must be applicable to any dataset tackling the same task or even other similar tasks.
* If your methodology introduces new mechanisms (e.g., neural networks, attention mechanisms):
  * A figure must be drawn per mechanism (e.g., see Figures 1 and 2 in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04943.pdf)).
  * Equations are preferred over a block of text when appropriate (e.g., see Sections 3.2 ~ 3.4 in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04943.pdf)).
* Figures must be exported as PDF with no white margin around them.
* Avoid spending so much space to explain work done by others. Focus on the novelty of your methodology and make clear distinctions between your methodology and the previous work.
* Justify that your methodology suits well to prove your hypothesis in the introduction.
* If you are writing a survey paper, you must include comparative studies in methodologies among related work.
