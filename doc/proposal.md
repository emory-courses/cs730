# Proposal

## Report

Create a section called `Introduction` and write the followings (preferably in order):

* Importance of the proposed topic (e.g., _QA has recently gained lots of interests_).
* Challenges with the previous work (e.g., _QA performance on dialogue is still poor_).
* Hypothesis to address those challenges (e.g., _By redesigning language models for dialogue contexts, QA will improve_).
* Proposed approaches to support the hypothesis (e.g., _We introduce a new transformer called ..._).
* Significance (novelty, intellectual merits, and broader impact) of the proposed work.
* List of contributions.

Every point must be made with evidences.
Cite relevant (and high impact) papers to make your point stronger.
No need to explain them explicitly in this section, which will be done in the `Releated Work` section.

## Presentation

Create slides for a 20-min presentation that comprises the followings:

* Problem statement.
* All the contents from the report.
* Experimental design describing datasets, evaluation metrics, and baseline models.
* Timeline: weekly plans of the proposed research towards a specific paper deadline.

## Submission

* `Introduction` must be 1-1.5 pages (2-3 columns).
* Submit the report and the slides in PDF: https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/68418/assignments/292959
